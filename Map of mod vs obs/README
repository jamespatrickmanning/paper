This folder has a routine "map_obs_vs_mod.py" to create two types of maps:

1) obs minus model scatter plots  with multiple panels.
2) obs minus model binned plots  with multiple panels

The input file (as of late April 2020) is "vessels_df_C.csv" which comes originally from "dictionary.json".
More notes need to be available on how this input file was created.
It has LOTS of different options as documented in the "hardcode" section of the code.
