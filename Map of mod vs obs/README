This folder has routines to create two types of maps:
1) obs minus model scatter plots "Map_obs_modelscatter.py" with multiple panels.
2) obs minus model binned plots  "bin_fishtemps.py"
where we might consider combining them into one file in the future.
The input file (aas of late April 2020) is "vessels_df_C.csv" which comes originally from "dictionary.json".
